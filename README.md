This is the code for a model-checker for Probabilistic Computational Tree Logic (PCTL) over Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMC) written in prolog (for [SICStus prolog](https://sicstus.sics.se/)), and implemented in ProB.

Before a presentation of the model-checker some useful comments about it, here's how the files are ordered :
- The examples contains 4 different models used for benchmarking. They can countain :
    - An [XTL](https://prob.hhu.de/w/index.php?title=Other_languages) version of the model, used to run the model-checker with [ProB](https://prob.hhu.de/w/index.php?title=The_ProB_Animator_and_Model_Checker).
    - A [PRISM](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/) version of the model, as well as a list of pctl formulas over it
    - A B-machine representation of the model
    - A prolog representation of the model, used for tests with the prolog version of the model-checker
    - A prolog state space generated by the ProB from a B machine
- The version of the model-checker which is implemented in the ProB core
- A prolog version of the model-checker, working on its own, used for testing, as well as some archives of different approach studied for the model-checker.

## PCTL syntax
*For an introduction to PCTL and DTMC, look at the [PRISM lecture notes](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/lectures/pmc/)*

The idea of PCTL is to specify temporal properties on a model while taking into account probabilities.

For instance, the formula $P_{<{0.75}}[X {finished}]$ states that the probability that the next state verify the property "finished" is strictly less than 0.75.

The PCTL formulas accpted by the [parser](https://github.com/hhu-stups/probparsers/tree/PCTLparser/ltlparser) are separated onto 2 categories : path formulas and state formulas.

A state formula $\phi$ is either :
- *true*
- *false*
- {property}, with property being defined on the dtmc
- $\phi_{1}$ & $\phi_{2}$
- $\phi_{1}$ or $\phi_{2}$
- $\phi_{1} \rightarrow \phi_{2}$
- $\phi_{1} \leftrightarrow \phi_{2}$
- not $\phi$
- $P_{op\{probability\}}[\Phi]$, with $op \in \{<,>,\le,\ge\}$, probability beign either a variable or a number between 0 and 1, and $\Phi$ being a path formula.

A path formula $\Phi$ is either :
- X $\phi$, the next operator, with $\phi$ being a state formula
- F $\phi$, the eventually operator
- F $\le{k}$ $\phi$ with $k$ being an integer different than 0, the bounded eventually operator
- G $\phi$, the always operator
- G $\le{k}$ $\phi$ the bounded always operator
- $\phi_{1}$ U $\phi_{2}$, the until operator
- $\phi_{1}$ U $\le{k}$ $\phi_{2}$, the bounded until operator

Note that, as in PRISM, the syntax is extented to add = as an operator in a probabilistic path formula. This allow to evaluate the probability of a path from a certain state

To evaluate such a formula using ProB, you have to [load a model](https://prob.hhu.de/w/index.php?title=Using_the_Command-Line_Version_of_ProB) into the [REPL](https://prob.hhu.de/w/index.php?title=ProB_REPL) and to enter the formula you want to verify as `:pctl formula`
