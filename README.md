This is the code for a model-checker for Probabilistic Computational Tree Logic (PCTL) over Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMC) written in prolog (for [SICStus prolog](https://sicstus.sics.se/)), and implemented in ProB.

Before an introduction to thoses notions and some useful comments about it, here's how the files are ordered :
- The examples contains 4 different models used for benchmarking. They can countain :
    - An [XTL](https://prob.hhu.de/w/index.php?title=Other_languages) version of the model, used to run the model-checker with [ProB](https://prob.hhu.de/w/index.php?title=The_ProB_Animator_and_Model_Checker).
    - A [PRISM](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/) version of the model, as well as a list of pctl formulas over it
    - A B-machine representation of the model
    - A prolog representation of the model, used for tests with the prolog version of the model-checker
    - A prolog state space generated by the ProB from a B machine
- The version of the model-checker which is implemented in the ProB core
- A prolog version of the model-checker, working on its own, used for testing, as well as some archives of different approach studied for the model-checker.

## PCTL syntax
*For more details, look at the [PRISM lecture notes](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/lectures/pmc/)*

A PCTL formula is written as `sat(Formula,E)`, with `E` being a state and `Formula` being a probabilistic formula or a classic logical operator (`true`, `false`, `and(Formula1,Formula2)`, `or(Formula1,Formula2)`, `imp(Formula1,Formula2)`).
A probabilistic formula is written as `prob_formula(Operator,Probability,CTL_Formula)` with `Operator` being a comparison operator (`sup`,`inf`,`eq`..), `Probability` being a (Prolog) variable or a number between 0 and 1, and `CTL_Formula` being one CTL formula of the follows :
- Next : `x(Property)`
- Until bounded : `u(Property1,K,Property2)`
- Until : `u(Property1,Property2)`
- Always bounded : `g(K,Property)`
- Always : `g(Property)`
- Eventually bounded : `f(K,Property)`
- Eventually : `f(Property)`
